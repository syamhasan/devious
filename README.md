## Vagrant Requirements

Before running `vagrant up`, please make sure that you've installed the required Vagrant plugins:

- [Vagrant Hostupdater](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater)
- [Vagrant VirtualBox Guest Additions](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest)

### Vagrant::Hostupdater

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater
```

### Vagrant::VirtualBox Guest Additions

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

In case, somehow, you don't do this, or you just don't require this on you machine's Vagrant. You can always enabled `vbox_guest_additions` role on `development.yml` file. But, you have to make sure that you had the right kernal and VirtualBox version added to `roles/vbox_guest_additions/defaults/main.yml`.

## Get Started

Run...

```
vagrant up
```

And wait... there will be a prompt asking for your machine admin/root password, just enter them. This will allow Hostupdater to do it's job on the `/etc/hosts` file.

... and you're done!

You local development machine address is [http://localhost.devio.us](http://localhost.devio.us).
